# 🍅 Modeling Postharvest Tomato Losses in Florida’s Tomato Supply Chain

This repository showcases the computational work from my **PhD in Agricultural Data Science**, where I developed models to understand, simulate, and reduce **postharvest tomato losses** in Florida’s fresh-market tomato system.

The project blends **data engineering**, **mathematical optimization**, and **simulation** to tackle one big question:

> How can we move tomatoes from farm to consumer with minimal waste, even under uncertainty?
